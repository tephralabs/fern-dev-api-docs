# âœ… Create a customer

Customers are your end-users and can be either businesses or individuals. Before they can transact with Fern, each customer must complete a **Know-Your-Customer (KYC)** process. Fern manages this process to ensure secure and compliant fund transfers, giving you confidence in every transaction.

### Step-by-step guide

{% step %}
### Create a customer&#x20;

Create either a business or individual customer via the [**Customers API**](../../api-reference/customers/).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Retrieve KYC link

Upon successful customer creation, a hosted KYC link requesting the required information to fill in will be generated. This may be distributed to your end-user for completion, or it can be completed on the customer's behalf by your team.&#x20;

Typically, individuals take 5 minutes to complete the form, and business take 10-15 minutes. ([Sample KYC link](https://app.gitbook.com/o/tqA83i7VnVJ0rFiSNcBO/s/PNfGZh0Pi9izjESrZ2DP/) | [Sample KYB link](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Js7P0SWRFOVcMapukd7GzE5D63w2))&#x20;

### Check customer status

The status of the customer will be automatically updated via webhooks. Should additional information be needed from your end-user, we will contact them directly to alleviate any action on your part.

If your customer has already been verified by Fern (e.g., they are an existing Fern customer), their status will be automatically updated to **Active**.
