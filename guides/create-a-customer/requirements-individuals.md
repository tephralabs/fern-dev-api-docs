# âœ… Requirements - Individuals

Individual customers are required to provide certain information to complete identity verification. Fern oversees the entire verification process on your behalf, eliminating the need for you to manage it directly.

Here is a **sample KYC link** showing the form presented to your customers, along with a detailed list of the information collected:

* Name
* Address
* Date of Birth
* Government-issued ID number (SSN for US residents)
* Government-issued identity document
* Proof of address (mandatory for EEA residents, optional for others)

**Typical completion time:** 5-10 min&#x20;

**Typical time to approval:** Minutes to 1 day

If additional documents or information are needed (e.g. uploaded ID has expired), our compliance team will contact your end-customer directly to complete the verification process.
