**Notes:**

* Crypto-to-crypto transactions are available for all customer statuses. Fiat-related services require `ACTIVE` status.

## Notifications

Fern notifies customers via email at each step of the verification process, handling the entire process on your behalf. For customers who wish to communicate with their customers directly about additional information that is needed, we can work with you to send RFIs to you and you can coordinate with your customer.
