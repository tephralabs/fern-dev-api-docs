# Requirements for Individuals

Individual customers are required to provide certain information to complete identity verification. Fern oversees the entire verification process on your behalf, eliminating the need for you to manage it directly.

**Information collected:**

* First name
* Last name
* Address
* Date of birth
* Government-issued ID number (SSN for US residents)
* Government-issued identity document
* Proof of address (optional for some users, mandatory for those who are based in certain regions)

**Typical completion time:** <5 min&#x20;

**Typical time to approval:** <5 min to 1 business day

If additional documents or information are needed (e.g. uploaded ID has expired), the Fern compliance team will contact your end customer directly to complete the verification process.
