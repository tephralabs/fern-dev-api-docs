# Create and verify customers

Customers are your end users. Fern supports businesses and individuals as end users. Before your customer can transact with Fern, they must complete a customer verification process, i.e. **Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB)**. Fern manages this process to ensure secure and compliant funds transfers, giving you confidence in every transaction.
