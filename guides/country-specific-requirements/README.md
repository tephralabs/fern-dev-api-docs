Fern supports transactions with 50+ fiat currencies across 130+ countries. There's a lot of complexity to manage! This section includes guides for each country, including supported currencies, transaction types (payins/payouts), payment account types, and requirements to successfully set up local payment accounts to set you up for success when integrating Fern.
