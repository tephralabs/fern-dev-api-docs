# âœ… Third-party payments (Coming soon)

Third-party payments allow your customers to convert crypto to fiat and pay out via local payment rails. This feature is particularly useful for supporting cross-border transactions, such as contractor or vendor payments.

To initiate a third-party payment to another beneficiary, use the **Quotes API** and **Transactions API**, just as you would for onramps and offramps.

If you're interested in enabling this feature, please contact us at support@fernhq.com.
