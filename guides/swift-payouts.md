# SWIFT payouts

Fern supports SWIFT payouts for B2B payments. During payment account creation, select `SWIFT` as the `bankAccountPaymentMethod`.&#x20;

SWIFT is supported for businesses only and requires a minimum transaction size equivalent to $1,000 USD. SWIFT support is also not automatically granted for every approved Customer. If you want to activate SWIFT rails for your Customer, please send the Fern team a message through one of our [Support channels](../overview/help-and-support.md).
