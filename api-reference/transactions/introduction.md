# Additional details

## Transaction sizes

Each transaction must have a minimum value of **$10**, calculated based on the sending amount. Transactions below this threshold will not be accepted. There is no upper limit on the transaction size.

## Transaction statuses

## Notifications

Fern notifies customers via email at various steps of the transaction to keep them fully aware of the progress.

Additionally, you can use webhook events to trigger your own notifications, offering in-context guidance and next steps tailored to each customer state. (Coming soon)

## Transaction failures

In rare instances, transactions may fail. When this happens, any received funds will be returned to the sending address, and the transaction will need to be re-initiated. The **GET /transactions** endpoint provides the failure reason, allowing you to address the issue and take corrective action. The failure reason will also be available in the developer dashboard.&#x20;

### Possible failure reasons

This is a non-exhaustive list that will grow over time.&#x20;
