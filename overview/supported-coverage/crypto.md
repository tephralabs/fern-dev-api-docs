## Cryptocurrencies

Fern can support currency conversion for several cryptocurrencies on each of the supported networks. Each transaction type has a different set of supported currencies.

### Onramps

Fern supports onramps to Circle-issued USDC on the supported networks.

### Offramps

Fern supports offramps from any native cryptocurrency and ERC-20 on the supported networks. The token must have sufficient DeFi liquidity when swapping with USDC with minimal slippage and price impact in order to be supported for offramps.&#x20;
