SLA:&#x20;

* What is the 90th percentile SLA for developer products out there?
  * 15 min for critical issues, 4 hours for everything else?&#x20;
  * 24 hour resolution?&#x20;
* What can we actually commit to as a team?&#x20;
  * Issues with API are covered by on-call issues
  * Non-technical issues: covered by Gloria&#x20;
  * Technical issues: covered by on-call?

Slack

* Benefits of Slack community
  * Allows users to help each other troubleshoot
  * Feels more developer-centric
  * Possibly build our reputation if they see XYZ is using us
* Cons of Slack community&#x20;
  * An additional channel to manage and keep users active&#x20;
  * Users will be able to see each other (some of them might be competitive with each other)&#x20;
* Recommendation:
  * Start with just individual Slack channels and create a Slack community if there are >10 developer users + demand from those users
