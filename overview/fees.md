# Earning revenue with Fern

Fern is designed to create revenue generation opportunities for our developer partners.

* **Currency conversion:** For on/offramps, FX, and crypto swaps, you can set a **developer fee** indicating the amount that you'd like us (Fern) to deduct from the transaction. We will settle this revenue payment with you on a monthly basis, in either USD or USDC.
  * Developer fees are deducted before funds reach the user's destination account. If you set an empty or zero developer fee, the customer will get the full amount in their account.
* **Multi-currency accounts and wallets:** You can charge your end users for the creation of multi-currency accounts and wallets.
* **Yield:** Some Fern products enable your users to earn yield on funds at rest. You can specify a percentage amount that you'd like to earn on yield generated, as well as the amount you'd like to go back to your users.
* **Cards:** Fern shares interchange fee with partners integrating our cards solution.



We want you to be successful, and to grow with you as your business grows.
