# âœ… Slippage & Price impact

Converting ERC-20 tokens, especially those with smaller market caps, can result in significant price impact. To safeguard your customers and maintain competitive pricing, any offramp transaction exceeding a price impact threshold of <mark style="color:red;">**X%**</mark> will be marked as failed.&#x20;

The <mark style="color:red;">**XXX webhook**</mark> will provide the failure reason, enabling you to take appropriate action. You can attempt the offramp again later when market conditions improve.
