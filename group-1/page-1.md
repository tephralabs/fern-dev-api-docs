# Your first transaction

Once you have onboarded successfully, you can start creating your first transaction and testing out the Fern APIs.&#x20;

### Create a customer

All transactions must occur with a registered and verified customer. You can reference [this guide](../guides/create-a-customer/) for step-by-step instructions on how to create a customer.

{% hint style="info" %}
While you can add any customer as your first customer, we recommend starting with **yourself**, as youâ€™ll already have pre-approval. This allows you to test other APIs immediately without waiting for customer verification.&#x20;

### Create a transaction&#x20;



The step-by-step guides here walk you through creating an [onramp](../guides/first-party-onramps.md) or [offramp](../guides/first-party-offramps.md), depending on the fund flow you wish to support. Alternatively, you can refer directly to the [**Bank Accounts API**](bank-accounts.md), **Quotes API**, and [**Transactions API**](../api-reference/transactions/) for more detailed implementation.
