## Getting started

The Fern API is currently in **private beta**. If you're interested in building with the Fern API, please send us a note at [hello@fernhq.com](mailto:hello@fernhq.com) so we can discuss your use case. Once you've decided to build with Fern, onboarding is straightforward:

{% step %}
### Undergo business verification (KYB)

Create an account at [app.fernhq.com](https://app.fernhq.com/), making sure to indicate that you plan to use Fern for your business. You'll see an option to complete KYB. It should take 10-15 min to complete. For more details on the information needed, refer to [Requirements - Businesses](guides/create-and-verify-customers/requirements-for-businesses.md).&#x20;

In the meantime, we will set up a dedicated Slack or Telegram channel to connect you directly with our team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Get full access to Fern Business and the Developer dashboard

Once verified and approved, you'll have full access to Fern. Get started by visiting the [Developer dashboard](overview/developer-dashboard.md). You can also leverage Fern's integrated on/offramps for your business needs and invite other team members to join your account.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Commercials & API keys

Once you have finalized commercials with the Fern team, we will reach out to share your API keys with you securely. Be sure to copy and store the key safely, as you will not be able to see the key in your Developer dashboard or other Fern interface afterwards.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Start building

Get started with creating your first customers and transactions! Feel free to reach out to the Fern team through Slack, Telegram, or email for any support.
