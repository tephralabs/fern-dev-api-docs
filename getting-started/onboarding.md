### Undergo business verification (KYB)

Sign up on [app.fernhq.com](https://app.fernhq.com/), and complete your business verification there. It should take 10-15 min to complete. For more details on the information needed, refer to [Requirements - Businesses](../guides/create-a-customer/requirements-businesses.md).&#x20;

In the meantime, you’ll be set up with a dedicated Slack channel to connect directly with our team.

Once verified and approved, you'll gain full access to Fern. Visit the **Developer Dashboard** at **XXX** to get started. You can also leverage Fern's integrated on/offramps for your business needs, and add other members of your team to the account.
