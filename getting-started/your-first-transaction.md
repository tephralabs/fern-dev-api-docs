# Your first transaction

Once you have onboarded successfully, you can start creating your first transaction and testing out the Fern APIs.&#x20;

### Create and verify a customer

All transactions must occur with a registered and verified customer. You can reference [this guide](../guides/create-and-verify-customers/) for step-by-step instructions on how to create a customer.

{% hint style="info" %}
While you can add any customer as your first customer, we recommend starting with **yourself**, as youâ€™ll already have pre-approval. This allows you to test other APIs immediately without waiting for customer verification.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Initiate your first transaction

Follow the guides for creating an [onramp](../guides/first-party-onramps.md) or [offramp](../guides/first-party-offramps.md). You're off to the races!
